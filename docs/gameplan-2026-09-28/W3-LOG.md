# W3 log: positioning and decision quality (logged during W2, not fixed)

These come from the owner's reel v0 notes and the W2 detector runs. They are about how the agent engine plays, so they belong to W3 (designed team plays). W2 left them alone on purpose.

## From the owner's reel v0 notes
- **D runs to the far boards.** "defenseman skating into boards on other side of play for no reason" (2-on-1). The D chooses support or a gap read with no relation to the rush.
- **Two defend one.** "two people defending one guy" (2-on-1). Coverage assignment doubles the puck carrier and leaves the second attacker open.
- **New men ignore the puck.** "three people come off the bench and ignore the guy with the puck right in front of them" (line change). Men coming on skate to their shape spots before they read the puck. W2 now brings them over the boards at their own door, so W3 should judge this again.
- **Positioning looks bad overall.** "positioning of all the players just looks bad" (save + rebound). There is no shared D-zone coverage structure, such as a box+1 or a collapse on the rebound.
- **Standing still in dangerous areas.** "too much standing still in dangerous areas". Support players arrive at a spot and stop (low-urgency support). The 0.25 s re-think with no play intent is the root cause (ROOT-CAUSES RC4).
- **Crease camping.** "he stands in the crease with the puck for so long doing nothing" (classic PP; check it on the agent engine). Carrier decisions in tight have no time-out and no "jam it / walk out" choice.
- **Looked offside.** "looked offside" (classic empty net). Check offside reads on the agent engine against the drawn blue line.

## Found by the detectors during W2
- **VT8: an on-the-fly shape change mid-ice.** An extra attacker returning, or a strength change during live play, swaps men in place: `deploySide(s, true, true)` from `beginChange` when incoming ≠ outgoing. Those men should go through the door like any other change. Seen once in 10 clips (empty net, P3 1:23).
- **VT9: framing.** The puck is on screen only 74–96% of live broadcast frames, and the carrier sits in the middle third 55–100% of the time. The camera framing lock is part of the W3 exit ("camera framing locked for this slice").
- **Stoppage time eats the period clock in the agent sim.** `now` runs through dead time. Any longer faceoff set or change therefore cuts live play and shot volume. A stricter faceoff "set" check (speed < 3 ft/s) cost about 6% of shots, so it was reverted. W3 should decide whether dead time stops the sim clock (as in the NHL) and then recalibrate once.
- **The bench is empty.** W2 deleted the standing bench rigs (they read as "too many men"). Nobody sits on the bench now, and the goal sequence's bench shot shows empty benches ("bench doesn't celebrate"). Bench life is W5 content.
